<h2 id="prof-martyn-thomas-cbe-wednesday-15th-february"><strong>Prof Martyn Thomas, CBE, Wednesday 15th February</strong></h2>

<p>Cyber-attacks are a <strong>Tier One Risk</strong> on the National Risk register. The 2011-2016 Cyber Security Strategy spent £850 million but the risk today is higher than it was in 2011, a National Cybersecurity Centre has opened in London and a new Cyber Security Strategy has recently been published.</p>

<p>Most countries now have offensive cyberattack capabilities. Internationally, cyberattacks have affected the nuclear programme in Iran, twice brought down the power grid in Ukraine and attempted (perhaps successfully) to influence the outcome of the election of the next US President. Much of the next war will be fought in cyberspace and the use of cyberattacks by terrorists could suddenly increase.</p>

<p>Martyn Thomas will describe the cyber threats to homes, cars and national infrastructure, explain how some common cyberattacks work, show why current approaches to cybersecurity are largely ineffective, and argue that the UK’s cybersecurity strategy is fundamentally flawed. He may be persuaded to offer some solutions.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/21/jeep-owners-urged-update-car-software-hackers-remote-control"><em>&lsquo;Jeep owners urged to update their cars after hackers take remote control&rsquo;, Guardian Newspaper, 21 July 2015.</em></a> Security bug allows remote attack of Uconnect system, letting hackers apply the brakes, kill the engine and take control of steering over the internet.</p>

<p><strong><em>Professor Thomas CBE FREng</em></strong> has worked in computing since 1969. He founded a leading software engineering company, became a partner in Deloitte &amp; Touche, was a director of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and is now a main board director of the Heath and Safety Executive. He chaired a recent review of MoD’s cybersecurity capabilities and was a member of the team that reviewed cybersecurity science and technology across all Government departments for the National Security Council. He is a member of the Cyber Experts Group of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat and the first Professor of Information Technology at Gresham College.</p>
