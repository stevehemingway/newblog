      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is (going to be) a blog created on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using the &lt;strong&gt;HPSTR&lt;/strong&gt; theme by &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/mmistakes&#34;&gt;Michael Rose&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s all on the web &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dldx/hpstr-hugo-theme&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The great thing about this is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to have server processing, so you can host absolutely anywhere (although to upload to the server with git, the webserver will have to be running a git daemon.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write the pages in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34;&gt;markdown markup&lt;/a&gt; which means that you can use any old editor you like, including vi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have tremendous integration with git, especially if you choose to host with &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt; which is quick, professional, and absolutely free, both as in beer and as in speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you use hugo, which is free (in both senses) and fun, and not only generates your html but also runs runs a local web server so you can check out the look and feel of your website locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you put a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML&#34;&gt;yaml&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of each page, which is a alternative to clunky xml and json. I was going to say that it&amp;rsquo;s new, but it&amp;rsquo;s been around for 15 years, which you&amp;rsquo;ll discover if you click the link, which is to Wikipedia, which, as we know, is 100% true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, you can find me around the web, on Twitter, on Facebook, and as the author of a couple of semi-private websites. I&amp;rsquo;m also on LinkedIn, Reddit and Hackernews. My interests are politics, cybercurrencies, science, maths, beer and my family, not necessarily in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Twitter the key Social Media Platform?</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experience-of-the-twittersphere&#34;&gt;My experience of the Twittersphere&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I&amp;rsquo;d better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been quietly tweeting since, without much traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of late I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to integrate a bit more automation, using ifttt.com, and simply linking my Twitter account to a FB page. I&amp;rsquo;d previously auto tweeted from my Tumblr blog, but that never seemed to do any good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent Â£10 to promote one tweet, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to FB.&lt;/p&gt;
