## Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area


The Environmental Area at the school is finished. It contains a large pond, where frogspawn will soon be turning into tadpoles, various pictures and carved figures from popular children's literature, resources for project work on nature study, mathematics, history and geography. There are lots of photos showing the how the Area has taken shape over many months of hard work by many volunteers, but especially Alena Evans.
