# About this website

This is my latest corner of the web.

I used to have a blog at Tumblr. The [old posts](http://stevehemingway.tumblr.com/) are still there, but I won't be adding to them. I generally don't see promoted posts in my browser, and I wasn't aware that my genuine posts were interspersed with promoted ones suggesting that people should check to see if they were due mis-sold PPI and the like. 

This is a price which is too much, especially as there are many free alternatives. I am hosting this both on my own mail server on digital ocean and on github pages, which is entirely free. I probably will drop the github pages hosting once I get comfortable with the Digital Ocean offering. 

I have various social media accounts. I'll sort out some links to them eventually.
