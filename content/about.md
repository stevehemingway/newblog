# About Steve

I am the Conservative candidate for Knebworth Ward of North Herts District Council.

You can read some of the material I've contributed to the Knebworth Parish News over the last four years [here](posts). The menu on the left organises them by date.

You can access this site at [stevehemingway.com](https://www.stevehemingway.com).
