This is (going to be) a blog created on [github](https://github.com) using [hugo](https://pages.github.com/).

I'm using the **HPSTR** theme by [Michael Rose](http://github.com/mmistakes). It's all on the web [here](https://github.com/dldx/hpstr-hugo-theme).  The great thing about this is:

* No need to have server processing, so you can host absolutely anywhere (although to upload to the server with git, the webserver will have to be running a git daemon.)
* You write the pages in [markdown markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which means that you can use any old editor you like, including vi.
* you have tremendous integration with git, especially if you choose to host with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is quick, professional, and absolutely free, both as in beer and as in speech.
* you use hugo, which is free (in both senses) and fun, and not only generates your html but also runs runs a local web server so you can check out the look and feel of your website locally.
* you put a bit of [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) at the beginning of each page, which is a alternative to clunky xml and json. I was going to say that it's new, but it's been around for 15 years, which you'll discover if you click the link, which is to Wikipedia, which, as we know, is 100% true.

As for me, you can find me around the web, on Twitter, on Facebook, and as the author of a couple of semi-private websites. I'm also on LinkedIn, Reddit and Hackernews. My interests are politics, cybercurrencies, science, maths, beer and my family, not necessarily in that order.
