# About Steve


You can read some of the material I've contributed to the Knebworth Parish News over the last four years [here](/posts). The menu on the left organises them by date.

I don't keep any data about you, so I don't have a need to have a privacy policy.

I don't personally do anything with cookies, but Google Analytics and Disqus probably do. If you are worried about them you can easily configure your browser to block them.
