I decided to load up my regular columns for Knebworth Parish News onto this website. The technology is not very familiar to me, and the original articles are in a less than perfect format for turning into web pages.

However, it's now more-or-less here, but if you do notice any broken links etc. please [tell me](mailto:steve@stevehemingway.com)!

For the technically curious, all the content here is written in markdown, and turned into a website using Hugo, which generates a static website using the content plus a template, which Michael Rose has kindly made available to the public.

The web server in this case is just my mail server, running on a Digital Ocean Droplet (i.e. a cheap cloud computing virtual private server).
