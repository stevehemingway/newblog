Last week the Parish Council decided to start the process of bidding to buy the
Station Pub. I voted against this decision for the following reasons:

- Support for a community bid to purchase the pub would be better channelled
through the community group set up for the purpose.

- villagers would be much more likely to financially support a community group
  than support the Parish council, as the latter has the power to impose a cost
on everyone in the village through increasing Council Tax. 

- local government, including Parish Councils, is not equipped to make the
  commercial decisions necessary to make a success of running business which has
to compete in a marketplace. The casual dining sector/pub sector is notoriously
competitive and is better left to a talented entrepreneur who has perfectly
aligned incentives to deliver a local service which maximised local utility. 

- supporting a pub through taxes is not fair on other local pubs restaurants and
  bars (including the Royal British Legion in Gun Lane).


In the [Bidding for an Asset of Community
Value](https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/community-right-bid/bidding-asset-community-value)
page from NHDC website it states,
"If there is more than one community group interested in purchasing the property,
we would encourage the groups to work together," 
 which is somewhat ambiguous, but to me suggests that a joint bid should be preferred to competing ones.
