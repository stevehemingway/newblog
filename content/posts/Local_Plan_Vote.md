I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth. This is simply untrue.  In the meeting of the full Council on 11th April 2017, I voted for the following motion:

>
> (1) That the results of the Proposed Submission consultation, as set out in the Regulation 22 Consultation Statement attached as Appendix 1 to the report, be noted and recorded;
>
> (2) That the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 2 to the report, together with the Schedule of Proposed Additional Modifications attached as Appendix 3, and other associated documentation, be approved and submitted for examination by the Secretary of State;
>
> (3) That the revised Local Development Scheme for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 4 to the report, be approved with effect from 12 April 2017;
>
> (4) That delegated powers be granted to the Head of Development and Building Control, in consultation with the Executive Member for Planning and Enterprise, to produce such additional documentation as is required (including documentation requested by the appointed Inspector and the proposing of main modifications) before and during the examination of the Local Plan; and
>
> (5) That Officers continue to regularly update Members on the progress of the Examination through the Strategic Planning Matters reports which are submitted to Cabinet.
>
> REASON FOR DECISION: To ensure that North Hertfordshire continues to progress a new Local Plan for the management of development in the District.

Further details of the meeting, including Appendix 1 mentioned in the resolution may be read on the NHDC website [here](https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=136&MeetingId=519&DF=11%2f04%2f2017&Ver=2).

This motion is purely about approving the Draft Local Plan and associated consultation response **for submission to** the Secretary of State. The Local Plan cannot come into effect until it has been examined by a Planning Inspector, who examines the Plan, in public, on behalf of the Secretary of State, writing a report and a schedule of 'main modifications' to the Plan if he finds it wanting. The Examination in Public finished last month, but the inspection has not. The final Inspector's Report has not yet been produced. It is very unlikely that the Secretary of State will adopt the Local Plan until 2019.

As I have written before, the Local Plan does not give permission for development of any sites around Knebworth. Before any sites on the periphery of the village are developed they will have to obtain full planning permission which will include the normal consultation process. No permission will be granted unless applicants can satisfy the statutory consultees that suitable infrastructure is in place.
