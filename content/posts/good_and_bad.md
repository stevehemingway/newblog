Prompted by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/status/1037854655458340865), I concluded that I believe the following:

* what hurts me but doesn't kill me often makes me wiser, or at least less likely to be hurt in future,
* my emotional reaction to a policy, derived from thinking about how it will affect me, or an individual I know (or hate) is a bad way of evaluating it,
* the idea that there are good people and bad people, or good tribes and bad tribes, is much less true than that people do things because they face incentives to do good or bad things.
