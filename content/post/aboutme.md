## Introduction

### Science
I've been interested in Science from an early age. I like to know facts about things and I like to know how things work. This is supposed to be a boy thing, but I think that everyone must be interested in these sorts of areas.

### Software
Ever since I learned to code as a sixth former, I have been fascinated by programming languages, and software. I am very privileged to have lived through a period of extraordinary creativity in the field of computing. The first machine I wrote software for had 128K of memory and filled a whole room in Cardiff City Hall. Your cheap digital watch will have more computing power now.

### Education
Education can be life changing. I know this, because it changed my life. I want everyone to have access to a potentially life-changing education.

### Economics
I see Economics as the science of how populations generate and distribute resources. I feel that it has a lot in common with thermodynamics, and (possibly) chemical kinetics. It is the closest thing that the social sciences has to a real science, even though on any metric it doesn't come very close.
