    <h2 id="future-of-the-knebworth-gp-surgery">Future of the Knebworth GP Surgery</h2>
<p>Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County
Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General
Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library
site into a new Library, a GP surgery and an associated pharmacy. This
is subject to HCC and GPI finding acceptable terms for the agreement.
Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham
Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the
Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where
we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that
HCC have confirmed their general intention.</p>
<p>I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this
development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern,
fit-for-purpose, GP surgery for many years to come. As many of you will
know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by
Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad
that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a
new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few years.</p>
<h2 id="norton-green-common">Norton Green Common</h2>
<p>I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in
the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the
Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is
registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency.
To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council.</p>
<p>I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major
progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green
Common. It would not have been possible without tireless effort on the
part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Parish Clerk.</p>
<h2 id="local-plan">Local Plan</h2>
<p>By the time you read this the Extraordinary Parish Meeting scheduled for
the 20th January will have been held. There is time to send your
response to the consultation to NHDC. Just email your comments to
<a href="mailto:localplans@north-herts.gov.uk">localplans@north-herts.gov.uk</a> or send via the post to Planning Policy,
NHDC, PO Box 480, Sale, M33 0DE. If you use email, please think about
copying in me and the Parish Council (<a href="mailto:clerk@knebworthpc.org.uk">clerk@knebworthpc.org.uk</a>). The
deadline for submissions is the sixth of February, so don&rsquo;t delay!</p>

<h2 id="nhdc-local-plan---preferred-options-consultation">NHDC Local Plan - Preferred Options Consultation</h2>
<p>The submissions made by members of the public to the Preferred Options Consultation, undertaken as part of the development of a new Local Plan, are now available on NHDC’s website. Every written response is available to read online - go to the page you get to by searching for &lsquo;&ldquo;Planning Policy Online Consultations&rdquo; north-herts&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="nhdcs-grants-policy">NHDC’s Grants Policy</h2>
<p>A report on Grants Policy is due to be discussed at the meeting of Cabinet on the 15th December. This will be reviewed by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee by the end of February 2016.</p>
<p>Grants represent a modest, but important part of North Herts District Council’s cost base, and have to be reviewed just as we review all our spending commitments. Knebworth has to pay for the upkeep of its village hall, pavilion and recreation grounds through the precept levied by Knebworth Parish Council. Voters in the towns in the District have the equivalent expenditure paid for directly by the District Council, ie through the Council Tax paid by all householders in the District. Rural grants, to a degree, compensate villages for this anomaly. For this reason, the review of grants policy is very important to us, and I will continue to argue for a fair deal for the &lsquo;parished&rsquo; areas.</p>
<p>I would like to take a moment to reflect on the passing year. 2015 was a notable year with a number of major proposals put forward, most now decided, but others, most notably the development of the draft Local Plan, that will continue into 2016. Some of these could have significant impact on the village, and I hope you will continue to make your views known, and I will continue to try to reflect these in discussions with NHDC as your elected councillor.</p>
<p>There will be changes to your representation on NHDC as my fellow councillor, Alan Bardett, will be retiring at the end of his term in May 2016 when local elections will be held for some of the wards within NHDC including, this time, Knebworth.</p>
<p>I look forward to the year ahead and wish you all a Happy New Year.</p>

    <h2 id="nhdc-waste-collection">NHDC Waste Collection</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>David Percival in last month&rsquo;s Parish News commented: &ldquo;contracted refuse collectors routinely dump emptied wheelie bins at random on pavements all around our village&rdquo;. I contacted the officer at NHDC responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the contract:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they
came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing
driveways or footpaths unnecessarily. Windy days can be a problem
generally however if they are returned to the boundary of a property
they are often next to a wall or hedge which helps prevent this
problem.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do have Waste Services Officers out monitoring the contract, so I
have copied [the relevant officer] in who will be about to check some
of the streets in Knebworth over the next few collections.</p>
<p>It is clear that the Veolia operatives are not perfect, but hopefully
this reminder will provoke an improvement in the service. If residents
notice any problems they can contact the NHDC helpdesk on 0800 328 6023
who will monitor the level of complaints from Knebworth. Alternatively
feel free to contact me about this directly.</p>
<h2 id="north-hertfordshire-local-plan">North Hertfordshire Local Plan</h2>
<p>NHDC is due to vote on moving to the next stage in the production of the
Local Plan at its meeting on 27th November. This will approve the Local
Development Scheme which sets out the timetable for consultation, but
will include the publication of the &ldquo;Preferred Options&rdquo;, i.e. sites
which the council have put forward as suitable for development.
Consultation on this document, as well as on the numerous planning
policies that together with the sites form the Plan, will take place
from early December through to the first week of February (these are
provisional dates and are still to be confirmed). Full information about
the proposals will be available in the Library and on the NHDC website.</p>
<h2 id="planning-matters---update">Planning Matters - Update</h2>
<p><em>Solar Farm PV Applications</em>: The Swangley’s Lane application was due to
be discussed by NHDC Planning Control at its committee meeting on
13<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> November but the NHDC officer wrote to advise me that it
had been withdrawn from the agenda as the applicant had written to the
planning officers &ldquo;setting out additional proposals to mitigate the
impact of the scheme on the surrounding landscape and to address the
concerns regarding the impact of the development on the Green Belt.&quot;.
There will now be further public consultation and NHDC expect it to be
discussed at the planning meeting on 18<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> December.
Consideration of the Three Houses Lane solar farm has been delayed
because of errors in the application and no date is yet scheduled for it
to come before the planning committee.</p>
<p><em>Knebworth Park Cricket Club</em>: Consideration of this application was
deferred by NHDC planning because of late submission of a revised design
of the pavilion and of a Flood Risk Assessment and drainage plans. It is
expected that the application will be reconsidered at the NHDC Planning
Control committee meeting on 18<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> December.</p>
<p><em>111 London Road</em>: Following our objections, the developer provided a
revised application with extra parking spaces and a contribution to
affordable housing in the NHDC area and the committee has now accepted
it.</p>

    <h1 id="application-to-redevelop-the-gp-surgery-at-1-stevenage-road">Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road</h1>
<p>The future of Knebworth and Marymead GP Practice at 1 London Road has
been uncertain for a considerable time. Various proposals for it moving
have been discussed without any coming close to fruition. A number of
residents were surprised to read about an application to redevelop the
surgery into eight one-bedroom flats, submitted by the owner of the
site.</p>
<p>As I understand it, this application was submitted to protect the
position of the owner in the event the surgery gives notice to quit. The
practice may do so at short notice under the current tenure, which, so
it is understandable that the landlord should enact some contingency
plans. The current surgery is outdated and unsatisfactory in a number of
ways: it would clearly be better if more modern premises were available,
whether on the current site, or another one. To find out more about the
options available I will be meeting with the surgery and a number of
interested parties in the second half of October.</p>
<h1 id="knebworth-park-cricket-club">Knebworth Park Cricket Club</h1>
<p>Of the order of sixty people turned up to the PC Planning Control
Committee on Monday 13th October to hear it consider the application for
a new clubhouse and two pitches on Jubilee Fields, to the east of Park
Lane opposite the Alms Houses and Mulberry Cottages in Old Knebworth.
Feelings ran high, with strong arguments on both sides. The committee
decided to oppose the application. A date for it to be considered by
NHDC has not yet been set. I am sure that when a date has been set there
will be a big turnout at the Council Chamber in Letchworth. You can be
sure that I&rsquo;ll be present and will be writing about the decision.</p>
<h1 id="bulwer-lytton-application">Bulwer Lytton application</h1>
<p>The developer has submitted an application to develop thirteen detached
houses on the site of the former care home, Bulwer Lytton House. Some of
these houses are close to neighbouring properties, they occupy a large
part of the plan of the site, and the plan allows for the retention of
fewer trees than the previous application, for outline planning
permission, submitted on behalf of HCC which owned the site. I will be
trying to persuade the Planning Control Committee at NHDC to reject this
application at its meeting on the 16th October.</p>
<h1 id="111-london-road-application">111 London Road Application</h1>
<p>The long awaited amended application for twenty-six one-bedroom flats on
the site of the former boy&rsquo;s home at 111 London Road was submitted and
reviewed by the Parish Council last month. The Planning Committee were
not persuaded that the changes addressed any of the grounds on which
they objected to the application the last time it was
considered.</p>
<h1 id="pondcroft-road-milestone-road-gun-lane-draft-traffic-regulation-order">Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order</h1>
<p>The consultation about introducing a Controlled Parking Zone in some
roads near Knebworth railway station finished in early October.
Unfortunately too early for me to draw attention to it in the previous
edition of this newsletter. I have not received any indication of the
results of this consultation from NHDC, as of today, but to the extent
that I received any feedback the balance of opinion was opposed to the
proposals, albeit with a number of residents being enthusiastic.</p>
<p>At the same time, although not part of the TRO, a preliminary
consultation to reduce the amount of parking in Watton Road took place.
I received one or two calls, but not enough to be confident of gauging
the general mood of residents in the road, which does suffer a great
deal as a &lsquo;rat run&rsquo; to parts of Stevenage, as well as being the main
route to the A602 south.</p>
<h1 id="solar-farms">Solar Farms</h1>
<p>The planning application for the proposed Solar Farm at Swangley’s Farm
has not yet been scheduled to come before a Planning Control Committee,
but the protestors continue to challenge the application. As I
understand it, an attempt is being made to challenge the decision to
dispense with an Environmental Impact Assessment as part of the
application. I expect that the application will go before NHDC this
month.</p>
<p>There is a second application to build a solar farm, this time on land
south of Three Houses Lane, north of Codicote. There was a lively
discussion about this application at the Parish Council Planning
Committee which was held on Monday 13th October. Although this is a
sparsely populated part of Knebworth Parish, a number of residents took
part in the Public Participation. The Parish Council decided to object
to the application on the grounds that it felt it was inappropriate for
the Green Belt.</p>
<h1 id="fly-tipping">Fly Tipping</h1>
<p>I have had a number of reports of fly tipping around Knebworth, made
directly to me. North Hertfordshire District Council treats fly-tipping
very seriously and will prosecute anyone caught fly-tipping waste. Fly
tipping is irresponsible, dangerous and expensive to clear up. There is
a form on the NHDC website (just search for ‘fly tipping’) or feel free
to contact me.</p>
<p>Fly tipping on private land is not the responsibility of the local
authority, but on the public highway it is. For larger scale fly tipping
the Environment Agency has a statutory duty to investigate fly tipping
when the waste may pose a serious threat to the environment.</p>
<h1 id="north-hertfordshire-local-plan">North Hertfordshire Local Plan </h1>
<p>The Local Development Scheme has now been published. It can be viewed on
the NHDC website (under Planning, Planning Policy and Projects). This
sets out a timetable for the development of the Local Plan. This process
includes several rounds of consultation, including one on the ‘Preferred
Options’ and on the submission itself, before it is formally submitted
to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in April
2016.</p>
<p>As far as anyone can tell, writing in mid-October, we are still on
course for submission of the preferred options paper, including the
potential housing sites, to Full Council on 27th November 2014.
Consultation on this paper is scheduled for the fifth of December to the
end of January 2015. Formal submission of the final version likely to
take place in Summer 2015.</p>
<p>If you are interested in finding out which parts of the District are
likely to see residential growth in the ‘plan period’ to 2031 please
check the Council’s website for the Full Council agenda which should be
available online from around mid-November.</p>
<p>There have been reports recently of extra clarification from the current
Secretary of State which appears to give priority to preservation of the
Green Belt over the directive to meet objectively assessed housing
needs, both ours and those of adjacent authorities. These conflicting
messages from Central Government need in my view to be resolved very
rapidly. I am joining with a number of my fellow district councillors in
urging the planning officers and members at NHDC to press for such
resolution.</p>

<p>Several significant applications are due to be considered by the KPC

comments to NHDC before the deadline if you have views, and/or raise
them with the KPC Planning Committee. As in all Parish and District
Council meetings, members of the public are welcome to attend committee
meetings:</p>
<p><strong>Knebworth GP Surgery</strong>: An application has been made for 1 Stevenage

the GP surgeries, Knebworth’s HCC representative, Cllr Richard Thake, is
fully involved.</p>
<p><strong>Solar Farms</strong>: At its last planning meeting KPC objected to the
proposed Swangley’s Lane Solar Farm, having had extensive discussion and
views expressed by residents, other members of the public and the
developer, and will be considering a second solar farm at Crouch Green,
on Three Houses Lane (deadline 16<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> October).</p>
<p><strong>Knebworth Park Cricket Club</strong>: An amended application is due to be

<h1 id="nhdc--capital-and-grant-funding-awards">NHDC – Capital and Grant Funding Awards</h1>
<p>Two awards of additional funding have been made by NHDC committees:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A grant of £7,000 has been awarded to Knebworth Parish Council by
the NHDC Rural Community Halls Capital Fund. This will allow a major
upgrade to the heating system in the Village Hall, just in time for
the cold winter months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Knebworth Day Centre for the vulnerable and elderly received a
boost when it received a grant of £1,000 from NHDC’s Southern Rural
Area Committee to help with operational costs. Knebworth Day Centre,
a not-for-profit organisation staffed by ten volunteers, has
provided social activities for elderly and frail people for 25
years, and currently around 15 members meet every Monday from 10am
to 3pm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="parking--proposals-for-further-restrictions">Parking – Proposals for Further Restrictions</h1>
<p>I hope that some of you were able to attend the meeting in the Village
Hall on 23<!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> September when proposals to introduce further
parking restrictions in Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Deanscroft, Gun
Lane, Gun Road and (to a minor extent) Station Road. There is also a
proposal, although at an earlier stage, to introduce parking
restrictions in Watton Road. Full details are available in the Library
or on the Parish Council and NHDC websites. Please be quick as the
deadline for comments is 3rd October – you can email comments to
<a href="mailto:transport@north-herts.gov.uk">transport@north-herts.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h1 id="norton-green-common">Norton Green Common</h1>
<p>Fly Tipping and illegal access to the SSSI on the Common continues to be
a problem. Representatives of Natural England and HCC have just been out
to look at the tipping and have proposed a solution to restrict access
on the Common by introducing bollards right along up to the beginning of
the SSSI. Knebworth Estates have agreed pay for the bollards as they
will also stop access to their woodland, which has suffered from fly
tipping in the past.</p>
