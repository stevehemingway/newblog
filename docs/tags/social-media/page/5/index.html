    <p>This article  appeared in the April edition of the Knebworth Parish News.</p>
<h3 id="chas-lowe-redevelopment">Chas Lowe Redevelopment</h3>
<p>You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders&rsquo; merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.</p>
<p>What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of sense. </p>
<p>The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in &lsquo;Category 2&rsquo;, the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is <em>in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden&rsquo;s dwelling.</em> This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size plot.</p>
<p>Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is received.</p>
<p>The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy ETC6 in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered suitable.</p>
<h3 id="may-elections">May Elections</h3>
<p>Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote.  If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact NHDC on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services. It is also possible to register to vote on-line, although voting itself still requires the use of a pen (or pencil) and paper.</p>
<h3 id="local-plan-update">Local Plan Update</h3>
<p>Officers at NHDC have been hard at work cataloguing the responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. This process will be complete by the 23rd March. The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State  for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with submission.  </p>
<p>Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the NHDC website. Search for &lsquo;Local Development Scheme&rsquo;. This is, obviously, subject to change.</p>
<h3 id="knebworth-community-chorus">Knebworth Community Chorus</h3>
<p>I am pleased to announce that Knebworth Community Chorus have received grants from NHDC and from the Knebworth Village Trust. This will provide them with staging and a new keyboard. The choir should now be fully equipped for its concert in the Village Hall on [insert date]. This is always a very entertaining and popular event, so book early to avoid disappointment.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at NHDC, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the community.</p>
<p>The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at NHDC for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from NHDC, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village Trust.</p>
<p>NHDC have   vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the NHDC Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in place.</p>
<p>The NHDC Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not &lsquo;parished&rsquo; and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the NHDC element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the District.</p>
<p>The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is  out of character with the surrounding buildings and  having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the decision.</p>
<p>A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the  the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation website.</p>
<p>With the GP surgery moving to St Martin&rsquo;s Road the defibrillator on the wall of the GP surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct way.</p>
