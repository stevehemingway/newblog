    <p>This is (going to be) a blog created on <a href="https://github.com">github</a> using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">hugo</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the <strong>HPSTR</strong> theme by <a href="http://github.com/mmistakes">Michael Rose</a>. It&rsquo;s all on the web <a href="https://github.com/dldx/hpstr-hugo-theme">here</a>.  The great thing about this is:</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to have server processing, so you can host absolutely anywhere (although to upload to the server with git, the webserver will have to be running a git daemon.)</li>
<li>You write the pages in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown markup</a> which means that you can use any old editor you like, including vi.</li>
<li>you have tremendous integration with git, especially if you choose to host with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> which is quick, professional, and absolutely free, both as in beer and as in speech.</li>
<li>you use hugo, which is free (in both senses) and fun, and not only generates your html but also runs runs a local web server so you can check out the look and feel of your website locally.</li>
<li>you put a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">yaml</a> at the beginning of each page, which is a alternative to clunky xml and json. I was going to say that it&rsquo;s new, but it&rsquo;s been around for 15 years, which you&rsquo;ll discover if you click the link, which is to Wikipedia, which, as we know, is 100% true.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I&rsquo;m still working (slowly) on putting this blog together, so I&rsquo;ve left a lot of the example site created by Michael in place while I work out how to delete categories and tags. The example site has a lot of example posts, which I will find helpful for a bit until I get going. It seems to be better documentation than I could find on the github page.</p>

<p>As for me, you can find me around the web, on Twitter, on Facebook, and as the author of a couple of semi-private websites. I&rsquo;m also on LinkedIn, Reddit and Hackernews. My interests are politics, cybercurrencies, science, maths, beer and my family, not necessarily in that order.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&rsquo;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&rsquo;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built.</p>

<p>On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in:</p>

<ul>
<li>a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the pub,</li>
<li>a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend,</li>
<li>a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits,</li>
<li>a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see the website <a href="https://www.stationpub.org.uk">here</a>, where you&rsquo;ll find links to all the aspects of the campaign&rsquo;s web presence.</p>

<p>What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I&rsquo;d like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their views.</p>

<h1 id="the-station-pub-knebworth">The Station Pub, Knebworth</h1>

<p>I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.</p>

<p>I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.</p>

<p>Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.</p>

<p>The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook.</p>

<p>Some people do not use FB, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go nowhere.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience-of-the-twittersphere">My experience of the Twittersphere</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&rsquo;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter Inc.</p>

<p>Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn&rsquo;t want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I&rsquo;d better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I&rsquo;ve been quietly tweeting since, without much traction.</p>

<p>Of late I&rsquo;ve decided to integrate a bit more automation, using ifttt.com, and simply linking my Twitter account to a FB page. I&rsquo;d previously auto tweeted from my Tumblr blog, but that never seemed to do any good.</p>

<p>Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it&rsquo;s just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent £10 to promote one tweet, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to FB.</p>

    <p>Here be a sample post with a custom background image. To utilize this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; just add the following YAML to a post&rsquo;s front matter.</p>
background: /images/filename.png

<p>This little bit of YAML makes the assumption that your background image asset is in the <code>/images</code> folder. If you place it somewhere else or are hotlinking from the web, just include the full http(s):// URL. Either way you should have a background image that is tiled.</p>

<p>If you want to set a background image for the entire site just add <code>background: /images/filename.png</code> as a <a href="https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/#examples">param</a> in your config and BOOM &mdash; background images on every page!</p>
