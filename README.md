This is me trying to create a github pages website

I used [this page](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/) to guide me through, adopting hpstr as my hugo template.

My main problems came from not being familiar enough with git (I had to use a submodule!).

I originally had a go using github pages using jekyll, but this seems much better. Hugo can be used to create static websites on virtually any web server that also is a git server. Dreamhost is one such host.
