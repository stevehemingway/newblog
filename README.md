This is me trying to create a github pages website

I used [this page](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/) to guide me through, adopting hpstr as my hugo template.


# Steve Hemingway's column for the Knebworth Parish News.

This is public domain, because I'm too mean to have a github paid account.

If you live in Knebworth you can get the paper magazine delivered.

I've now had a bit more practice with hugo as a web publishing tool. I am not an expert, but I manage to get what you see at [stevehemingway.com](https://stevehemingway.com) going ok. I leaned heavily on [This is a port of the HPSTR theme to Hugo.](https://github.com/dldx/hpstr-hugo-theme) which was mainly done (as far as I can see) by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes).
